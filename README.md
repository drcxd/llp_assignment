# Low Level Programming Assignment

This repository contains some assignments I did when I taught myself assembly language 
using
[*Low Level Programming*](https://www.amazon.com/Low-Level-Programming-Assembly-Execution-Architecture/dp/1484224027)
by Igor Zhirkov.

Following are some ineresting assignment involving assembly language.

# BMP Rotation

This program mainly focus on tranformation on bmp images. What is important is
I use SIMD commands to accelerate the program. Or, I should have. It seems
that I did not upload the asm file to the github. Maybe one day I will rewrite it.

# Dictionary

A dictrionary program written in assembly language. It uses a linked list to
stroe the words. This is actually used in another assignment which is the
forth interpreter.

# Forth

A Forth language implemented in assembly language. Support both interpreter and 
compiler mode.

# IO Library

A basic io library implemented in assembly language. This is a basic assignment
which is used to let me get familiar with assembly.
